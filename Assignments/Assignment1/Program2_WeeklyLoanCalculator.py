# Desc: Program 2 – Weekly Loan Calculator.
#
# Develop a short term loan calculator program as a console application
# with the following specifications. Begin by designing your solution to
# this problem in pseudocode, which will be submitted along with the program.
# If A dollars are borrowed at r% interest compounded weekly to purchase
# something with weekly payments for n years, then the weekly payment
# is given by the formula:
#
# If : i = r / 5200	
#
# Then calculate the weekly payment as: weekly payment = (i / 1 – (1 + i) exp-52n) * A
#
# Write a console application that calculates the weekly payment after
# the user gives the amount of the loan, interest rate, and number of years.
