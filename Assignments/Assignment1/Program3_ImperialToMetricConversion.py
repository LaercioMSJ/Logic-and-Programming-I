# Desc: Program 3 â€“ Imperial to Metric Conversion.
#
# Write a console program that converts a weight given in tons (imperial),
# stones, pounds, and ounces to the metric equivalent in metric tons,
# kilograms, and grams. Begin by designing your solution to this problem
# in pseudocode, which will be submitted along with the program.
#
# After the numbers of tons, stones, pounds, and ounces are input by the user,
# the weight should be converted entirely into ounces (the lowest common denominator)
# and then divided by 35.274 to obtain the value in kilos. The Python int function
# should be used to break the total number of kilos into a whole number of metric
# tons and kilos. The number of grams should be displayed to one decimal place.
#
# Required formulas:
# total ounces = 35840 * tons + 224 * stone + 16 * pounds + ounces
# total kilos = total ounces / 35.274
# metric tons = int(kilos/1000)

# PSEUDOCODE:
# Request the number of tons
# Request the number of stone
# Request the number of pounds
# Request the number of ounces
# Calculate the total of weight in ounces (35840 * tons + 224 * stone + 16 * pounds + ounces)
# Convert the total of weight in ounces to kilos (total ounces / 35.274)
# Convert the total of weight in kilos to metric tons ( int(kilos/1000) )
# Convert the total of weight in kilos to show only kilos
# Convert the total of weight in kilos to only grams
# Show on screen the metric tons, kilos, and grams
#

#
# OBSERVATION: I converted the total weight from ounces to kilos, following what was
# requested in the announcement, but in my opinion the best would be to convert ounces
# to grams (totalWeightInOunces / 0.035274). This would facilitate the calculation of all metric units.

    # PROCESS
    # Total of weight in ounces calculation

    # OUTPUT
    # Program shows on-screen the sentence contained within the quotation marks and the value contained in the variables metricTons, metricKilos, and metricGrams
    # Used \n to have a space line
    # The format method is used to return the formatted string.
